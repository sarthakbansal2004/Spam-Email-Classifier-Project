# 📧 Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Email Spam Detection is a Machine Learning based project that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)**.  
The project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and multiple Machine Learning algorithms to analyze email content and predict whether an email is spam.

This project helps in understanding how ML models can be applied to real-world problems like filtering unwanted emails.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

## 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithms Used
The following algorithms are used and compared in this project:

- **Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)**
- **Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)**
- **Random Forest Classifier (RFC)**

The trained models are saved using `.pkl` files for future predictions.

## ⚙️ How the Project Works
1. Email text data is collected and cleaned
2. Text preprocessing is performed (lowercasing, removing stopwords, etc.)
3. Text is converted into numerical format using vectorization
4. Machine Learning models are trained on the dataset
5. The trained model predicts whether an email is spam or not
6. Output is displayed as **Spam** or **Not Spam**
